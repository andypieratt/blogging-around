## Installation:

To install or use this application, you can either follow the deployed link at the top or you can clone this repository from GitHub. If you choose to clone it down, you will then have to open it up in VS Code or a similar platform and then run "npm i" in the command-line to install all the proper packages. You will also have to create a ".env" file and put in your specific DB_NAME (find this in the db/schema), DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD (mySQL specific to user). Once that is all accomplished, you can run "npm start" in the command-line and follow the http://localhost route to view your blog.

## Usage:

The main usage of this application is to allow users to communicate with one another over the common, shared interest of tech! Users are able to create, update, and delete their blog posts while also allowing them to view other user's posts. This blog is exclusive and requires users to either login or sign-up to participate.
